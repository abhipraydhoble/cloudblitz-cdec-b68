# 🔴 **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and maintain software efficiently and reliably.

## 1️⃣ Planning

* Define project goals and scope
* Estimate **time, cost, and resources**
* Identify risks and mitigation strategies

## 2️⃣ Requirement Analysis

* Gather business and technical requirements
* Understand user expectations
* Prepare requirement specification documents

## 3️⃣ Design

* Create system architecture (HLD & LLD)
* Define components, databases, APIs, and workflows
* Ensure scalability, security, and performance

## 4️⃣ Development

* Write code according to design
* Integrate different modules
* Follow coding standards and best practices

## 5️⃣ Testing

* Verify software quality
* Identify and fix bugs
* Types:

  * Unit Testing
  * Integration Testing
  * System Testing
  * User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

## 6️⃣ Deployment

* Release software to production
* Configure servers and environments
* Provide user access and training if required

## 7️⃣ Maintenance

## ⚔️ Waterfall vs Agile

| Aspect           | Waterfall              | Agile                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Process          | Linear, phase by phase | Iterative, sprint-based |
| Flexibility      | Very low               | High                    |
| Planning         | Done once at start     | Continuous              |
| Delivery         | At the end             | Frequent                |
| User Involvement | Low                    | High                    |
| Testing          | After development      | Continuous              |
| Documentation    | Heavy                  | Lightweight             |
| Team Structure   | Siloed                 | Cross-functional        |
| Best For         | Fixed requirements     | Changing requirements   |
